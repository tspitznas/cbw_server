README.TXT for cbw_server example program

cbw_server.exe is an example program written in C# that listens for incoming connections from ControlByWeb devices on port 8000.
It acts like another CBW device. The HTTP requests sent out from the CBW devices are displayed in the console window. The CBW devices
are configured as if to control another CBW device but instead are directed to this program.
